\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item We have an extension $K$ over $F$, where $F$ is a field.
    \item $\alpha \in K$ is \textbf{algebraic over F} if it is the root of
        some nonzero polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$. Otherwise $\alpha$ is
        \textbf{transcendental over F}.
    \item The extension $K/F$ is algebraic if $\forall \alpha \in K$,
        $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$.
    \item If $\alpha$ is algebraic, $m_{\alpha, F}$ is the unique monic
        irreducible (a.k.a \textbf{minimal}) polynomial in $F[x]$ with
        $\alpha$ as a root. Any polynomial in $F[x]$ has $\alpha$ as a root
        \textbf{iff} it's divisible by $m_{\alpha, F}$. Define $\deg
        \alpha = \deg m_{\alpha, F}$.
    \item If $L/F$ is a field extension and $\alpha$ is algebraic over both
        $F$ and $L$, $m_{\alpha,L} \mid m_{\alpha,F}$.
    \item Given $m_{\alpha, F}$, $F(\alpha) \cong F[x]/(m_{\alpha, F}(x))$,
        where $F(\alpha)$ is the field generated by $\alpha$ over $F$. We
        have $[F(\alpha) : F] = \deg m_{\alpha}(x) = \deg \alpha$.
    \item $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ \textbf{iff} $F(\alpha)/F$ is
        finite (i.e $\deg \alpha < \infty$). I.e, if $\deg \alpha = n$ a
        polynomial of $\deg \leq n$ has $\alpha$ as a root, and if $\alpha$
        satisfies a polynomial of $\deg = n$ then $\deg F(\alpha) \leq n$.
    \item If the extension $K/F$ is finite, it is algebraic.
    \item Let $F \subseteq K \subseteq L$ be fields: $[L : F] = [L : K][K :
        F]$.
    \item If $L/F$ is a finite extension, $K \subseteq L$ is a field and $K
        \supseteq F$ s.t $F \subseteq K \subseteq L$, then $[K : F] \mid [L
        : F]$.
    \item An extension $K/F$ is \textbf{finitely generated} if there are
        elements $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_k$ in $K$ s.t $K = F(\alpha_1, ...,
        \alpha_k)$.
    \item The field generated over $F$ by a collection of elements in an
        extension field $K$ is the smallest subfield of $K$ containing these
        elements and $F$.
    \item $F(\alpha, \beta) = (F(\alpha))(\beta)$. I.e we may `adjoin'
        elements to $F$ and then close the resulting set over addition,
        subtraction, multiplication, and division to obtain a field.
    \item The extension $K/F$ is finite \textbf{iff} $K$ is generated by a
        finite number of algebraic elements over $F$. If the generators have
        degree $n_1, ..., n_k$ then $\deg F(\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_k) \leq
        n_1...n_k$.
    \item Suppose $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are algebraic over $F$. Then $\alpha
        \pm \beta$, $\alpha\beta$, and $\alpha/\beta$ ($\beta \not= 0$) are
        all algebraic.
    \item Let $L/F$ be an arbitrary extension. Then the collection of
        elements of $L$ that are algebraic over $F$ form a subfield $K$ of
        $L$.
    \item If $K$ is algebraic over $F$ and $L$ is algebraic over $K$, then
        $L$ is algebraic over $F$.
    \item Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be two subfields of a field $K$. Then the
        \textbf{composite field} of $K_1$ and $K_2$ denoted by $K_1K_2$ is
        the smallest subfield of $K$ containing both $K_1$ and $K_2$.
    \item Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be two finite extensions of a field $F$
        contained in $K$. Then $[K_1K_2 : F] \leq [K_1 : F][K_2 : F]$, with
        equality \textbf{iff} an $F$-basis for one of the fields remains
        linearly independent over the other field.
    \item Suppose that $[K_1 : F] = n$ and $[K_2 : F] = m$ where $(n, m) =
        1$. Then $[K_1K_2 : F] = [K_1 : F][K_2 : F] = nm$.
